# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page

This a Frontend Mentor project (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef).

The point of this project was to test my frontend abilities by integrating the mockups that was given.

Even though this isn't a big project, i decided to use webpack to get a little more familiar with it. I'm also using sass and tried to organized this project in a pattern inspired by this documentation : https://sass-guidelin.es/.
